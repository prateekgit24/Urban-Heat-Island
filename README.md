This repository contains my academic project on Urban Heat Island (UHI) analysis with a focus on major Indian cities during the summer of 2024. The project aims to understand how urbanization affects local temperatures and how cities behave differently during daytime and nighttime.

The work combines data analysis, visual interpretation, and case-based reasoning to highlight the intensity of UHI and its impacts on urban environments.

About the Project

Urban Heat Island (UHI) refers to the phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures than their surrounding rural regions. This happens due to factors such as dense infrastructure, reduced vegetation, waste heat from human activities, and urban geometry.

In this project, I analyzed temperature patterns of selected Indian cities to:

Compare urban vs surrounding temperatures

Study daytime and nighttime UHI intensity

Identify key drivers responsible for heat accumulation

Discuss practical mitigation strategies based on urban planning concepts

Key Highlights

Summer 2024 temperature data was used for analysis

Clear differences were observed between daytime and nighttime UHI effects

Some cities showed stronger UHI at night due to heat retention

Dense built-up areas and lack of vegetation were major contributors

Green infrastructure and cool materials showed strong mitigation potential

Case Studies Included

The project includes focused observations on cities such as:

Chennai

Bengaluru

Tirupati

Guwahati

Thiruvananthapuram

Each case highlights unique urban characteristics and their influence on UHI behavior.

Tools and Resources

Satellite imagery and map-based data

NASA Earth observation datasets

Google Maps

Excel for data analysis

QGIS for spatial interpretation
